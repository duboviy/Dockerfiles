[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/mit/mit.svg?v=102)](https://github.com/duboviy/Dockerfiles/) [![PRs & Issues Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs%20&%20Issues-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/duboviy/Dockerfiles/pulls) [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/duboviy/Dockerfiles/)

Dockerfiles I use at home. These are all automated builds (with Docker hub usage).

## Why I use Docker

"With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues’ OS X and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.

Developers can get going quickly by starting with one of the 13,000+ apps available on Docker Hub. Docker manages and tracks changes and dependencies, making it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps that developers build work. And with Docker Hub, developers can automate their build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private repositories.

Docker helps developers build and ship higher-quality applications, faster." -- [What is Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker#copy1)

## Prerequisites

### Linux

The 3.10.x kernel is [the minimum requirement](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/binaries/#check-kernel-dependencies) for Docker.

### MacOS

10.8 “Mountain Lion” or newer is required.


## Installation

### Linux

Quick and easy install script provided by Docker:

```
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

If you're not willing to run a random shell script, please see the [installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) instructions for your distribution.

If you are a complete Docker newbie, you should follow the [series of tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) now.

### Mac OS X

Download and install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/).  [Docker For Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) is nice, but it's not quite as finished as the VirtualBox install.  [See the comparison](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/).
Once you've installed Docker Toolbox, install a VM with Docker Machine using the VirtualBox provider:

```
docker-machine create --driver=virtualbox default
docker-machine ls
eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
```

Then start up a container:

```
docker run hello-world
```

That's it, you have a running Docker container.
If you are a complete Docker newbie, you should probably follow the [series of tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) now.

## Build image :
To build an image with docker using the Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -t <yourname/imagename> .
```

*Note*: Run in directory with Dockerfile.
The output after executing this command will be the ID of the new docker image.
The -t [name] flag here is used to tag the image.
To learn more about what else you can do during build, run `docker build --help`.


## Run container from image :
Using the image we have build, we can now proceed to the final step: creating a container running out app instance inside,
using a name of our choice (if desired with --name [name]).
```bash
docker run -i -t  --name <yourname/containername>  <yourname/imagename>
```

*Note*: If a name is not set, we will need to deal with complex, alphanumeric IDs which can be obtained by listing all the containers using ```docker ps -l```
To detach yourself from the container, use the escape sequence CTRL+P followed by CTRL+Q.
To expose container ports use arguments: -p 8080:8080
To run container in the background:
```bash
docker run -d -t <yourname/imagename>
```

## To remove all images and containers:
You use Docker, but working with it created lots of images and containers. You want to remove all of them to save disk space.

```
Warning: This will destroy all your images and containers. It will not be possible to restore them!
```

Execute those commands in a shell:

Delete all containers:
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
Delete all images:
```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

## Containers

[Your basic isolated Docker process](http://etherealmind.com/basics-docker-containers-hypervisors-coreos/). Containers are to Virtual Machines as threads are to processes. Or you can think of them as chroots on steroids.

### Lifecycle

* [`docker create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create) creates a container but does not start it.
* [`docker rename`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rename/) allows the container to be renamed.
* [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run) creates and starts a container in one operation.
* [`docker rm`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm) deletes a container.
* [`docker update`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/update/) updates a container's resource limits.

If you want a transient container, `docker run --rm` will remove the container after it stops.

If you want to map a directory on the host to a docker container, `docker run -v $HOSTDIR:$DOCKERDIR`. Also see [Volumes](https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet/#volumes).

If you want to remove also the volumes associated with the container, the deletion of the container must include the `-v` switch like in `docker rm -v`.

There's also a [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) available for individual containers in docker 1.10. To run docker with a custom log driver (i.e., to syslog), use `docker run --log-driver=syslog`.

### Starting and Stopping

* [`docker start`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start) starts a container so it is running.
* [`docker stop`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop) stops a running container.
* [`docker restart`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/restart) stops and starts a container.
* [`docker pause`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pause/) pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
* [`docker unpause`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/unpause/) will unpause a running container.
* [`docker wait`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/wait) blocks until running container stops.
* [`docker kill`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/kill) sends a SIGKILL to a running container.
* [`docker attach`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach) will connect to a running container.

If you want to integrate a container with a [host process manager](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/host_integration/), start the daemon with `-r=false` then use `docker start -a`.

If you want to expose container ports through the host, see the [exposing ports](#exposing-ports) section.

Restart policies on crashed docker instances are [covered here](http://container42.com/2014/09/30/docker-restart-pol


### Info

* [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps) shows running containers.
* [`docker logs`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs) gets logs from container.  (You can use a custom log driver, but logs is only available for `json-file` and `journald` in 1.10).
* [`docker inspect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect) looks at all the info on a container (including IP address).
* [`docker events`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events) gets events from container.
* [`docker port`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/port) shows public facing port of container.
* [`docker top`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/top) shows running processes in container.
* [`docker stats`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats) shows containers' resource usage statistics.
* [`docker diff`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/diff) shows changed files in the container's FS.

`docker ps -a` shows running and stopped containers.

`docker stats --all` shows a running list of containers.

### Import / Export

* [`docker cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp) copies files or folders between a container and the local filesystem.
* [`docker export`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/export) turns container filesystem into tarball archive stream to STDOUT.

### Executing Commands

* [`docker exec`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec) to execute a command in container.

To enter a running container, attach a new shell process to a running container called foo, use: `docker exec -it foo /bin/bash`.

## Images

Images are just [templates for docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/#how-does-a-docker-image-work).

### Lifecycle

* [`docker images`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images) shows all images.
* [`docker import`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import) creates an image from a tarball.
* [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build) creates image from Dockerfile.
* [`docker commit`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit) creates image from a container, pausing it temporarily if it is running.
* [`docker rmi`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi) removes an image.
* [`docker load`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load) loads an image from a tar archive as STDIN, including images and tags (as of 0.7).
* [`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save) saves an image to a tar archive stream to STDOUT with all parent layers, tags & versions (as of 0.7).

### Info

* [`docker history`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/history) shows history of image.
* [`docker tag`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag) tags an image to a name (local or registry).

### Cleaning up

While you can use the `docker rmi` command to remove specific images, there's a tool called [docker-gc](https://github.com/spotify/docker-gc) that will clean up images that are no longer used by any containers in a safe manner.

### Load/Save image

Load an image from file:
```
docker load < my_image.tar.gz
```

Save an existing image:
```
docker save my_image:my_tag > my_image.tar.gz
```

### Import/Export container

Import a container as an image from file:
```
cat my_container.tar.gz | docker import - my_image:my_tag
```

Export an existing container:
```
docker export my_container > my_container.tar.gz
```

### Difference between loading a saved image and importing an exported container as an image ?

Loading an image using the `load` command creates a new image including its history.  
Importing a container as an image using the `import` command creates a new image excluding the history which results in a smaller image size compared to loading an image.



## Registry & Repository

A repository is a *hosted* collection of tagged images that together create the file system for a container.

A registry is a *host* -- a server that stores repositories and provides an HTTP API for [managing the uploading and downloading of repositories](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerrepos/).

Docker.com hosts its own [index](https://hub.docker.com/) to a central registry which contains a large number of repositories.  Having said that, the central docker registry [does not do a good job of verifying images](https://titanous.com/posts/docker-insecurity) and should be avoided if you're worried about security.

* [`docker login`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login) to login to a registry.
* [`docker logout`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logout) to logout from a registry.
* [`docker search`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/search) searches registry for image.
* [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull) pulls an image from registry to local machine.
* [`docker push`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push) pushes an image to the registry from local machine.

### Run local registry

You can run a local registry by using the [docker distribution](https://github.com/docker/distribution) project and looking at the [local deploy](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/registry/deploying.md) instructions.

Also see the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/dockerproject.org/forum/#!forum/distribution).

## Dockerfile

[The configuration file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Sets up a Docker container when you run `docker build` on it. Vastly preferable to `docker commit`.  

Here are some common text editors and their syntax highlighting modules you could use to create Dockerfiles:
* If you use [jEdit](http://jedit.org), I've put up a syntax highlighting module for [Dockerfile](https://github.com/wsargent/jedit-docker-mode) you can use.
* [Sublime Text 2](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Dockerfile%20Syntax%20Highlighting)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-docker)
* [Vim](https://github.com/ekalinin/Dockerfile.vim)
* [Emacs](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-mode)
* [TextMate](https://github.com/docker/docker/tree/master/contrib/syntax/textmate)
* For a most comprehensive list of editors and IDEs, check [Docker meets the IDE] (https://domeide.github.io/)

### Get IP address

```
docker inspect $(dl) | grep IPAddress | cut -d '"' -f 4
```

or install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

```
docker inspect $(dl) | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'
```

or using a [go template](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect):

```
docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <container_name>
```

### Get port mapping

```
docker inspect -f '{{range $p, $conf := .NetworkSettings.Ports}} {{$p}} -> {{(index $conf 0).HostPort}} {{end}}' <containername>
```

### Find containers by regular expression

```
for i in $(docker ps -a | grep "REGEXP_PATTERN" | cut -f1 -d" "); do echo $i; done
```

### Get Environment Settings

```
docker run --rm ubuntu env
```

### Kill running containers

```
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```

### Delete old containers

```
docker ps -a | grep 'weeks ago' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm
```

### Delete stopped containers

```
docker rm -v $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
```

### Delete dangling images

```
docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)
```

### Delete all images

```

```

### Monitor system resource utilization for running containers

To check the CPU, memory, and network I/O usage of a single container, you can use:

```
docker stats <container>
```

For all containers listed by id:

```
docker stats $(docker ps -q)
```

For all containers listed by name:

```
docker stats $(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}')
```

For all containers listed by image:

```
docker ps -a -f ancestor=ubuntu
```
